## Impact Web-Dev Workshop

### Introduction
This repository contains all the code that we covered in the workshop. It includes basics of React and how to fetch data from open APIs. We then show that data on the frontend using React components. Make sure to **read through the comments** provided in the code to get a basic understanding of what is happening.

### Setup
You would need a code editor (I recommend VS Code). Other than that make sure to download node.js and postman for dev purposes

### Running React App
Make sure that you are in the directory of your choice. Then run the command ```npx create-react-app my-app```. ```my-app``` can be replaced by whatever name you want to give your app. Then run ```cd my-app``` (again ```my-app``` can be replaced by whatever name you've given your app). After that just run ```npm start``` and you should be all set up. You can then just refer to the code on the repository.

#### Only if you clone this repository
If you are cloning this repository, then you would want to run ```npm install``` and then run ```npm start``` inside the project folder.
